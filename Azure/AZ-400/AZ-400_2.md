# Implement DevOps development processes (20-25%)

* [Azure Repos](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/repos/get-started/what-is-repos?view=azure-devops)

* [Pull Request Merge Strategies: The Great Debate](https://blog.developer.atlassian.com/pull-request-merge-strategies-the-great-debate/)

## Design a version control strategy

### recommend branching models

* [Choose a process](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/boards/work-items/guidance/choose-process?view=azure-devops&tabs=basic-process)

  * Agile

    > User Story

  * Scrum

    > product backlog items(PBIs)

  * CMMI

    > can track requirements, change requests, risks, and reviews.

### recommend version control systems

* [Azure DevOps CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/cli/?view=azure-devops)

* [migrate code](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/learn/git/centralized-to-git)
  * [Migrate from TFVC to Git](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/learn/git/migrate-from-tfvc-to-git)

  * [Migrate from other system to Git](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/learn/git/migrate-other-systems-to-git)

### recommend code flow strategy

* [git branching guidance](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/repos/git/git-branching-guidance?view=azure-devops)

---
## Implement and integrate source control

### integrate external source control
### integrate source control into third-party continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) systems

* [ServiceNow](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/release/approvals/servicenow?view=azure-devops)

* Jenkins

  * [Using Azure Storage with a Jenkins continuous integration solution](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-java-jenkins-continuous-integration-solution)

    * install the Azure Storage plugin in Jenkins

  * [Migrate from Jenkins to Azure Pipelines](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/migrate/from-jenkins?view=azure-devops)

    * enable continuous deployment

      * if **hosted in azure**

        * enable it

      * if **on-premiss**

        1. PAT

        1. install plugin on Jenkins server

        1. username: empty

           password: PAT

---
## Implement and manage build infrastructure

### implement private and hosted agents

* [Azure Pipelines agents](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/agents/agents?view=azure-devops&tabs=browser)

  * have **agent pool Administrator** role to add pool

  * need PAT

* [[MS Learn] Host your own build agent in Azure Pipeline](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/host-build-agent/)

  * Public agent Limitations

    1. build job can run up to 6 hours.
       
    1. 10GB of storage for sources and output

    1. CPU, memory, network: Standard_DS2_v2

    1. can't sign in

    1. can't drop build artifacts to Universal Naming Convention (UNC) file shares

  * Timeout

    * self-host - forever

    * public repository Microsoft-hosted - 360 minutes

    * private repository Microsoft-hosted - 60 minutes

### integrate third party build systems

* [Build GitHub repositories](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/repos/github?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml)

  > **GitHub App** is the recommended authentication type

* [Bamboo](https://www.atlassian.com/software/bamboo)

  CI/CD

### recommend strategy for concurrent pipelines

* [Run parallel jobs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/licensing/concurrent-jobs?view=azure-devops)

  * Each job consumes a parallel job that runs on an agent. When there aren't enough parallel jobs available for your organization, the jobs are queued up and run one after the other

### manage Azure pipeline configuration (e.g. agent queues, service endpoints, pools, webhooks)

* use ```batch``` flag in azure pipeline yaml to queue other **builds**

* [Define variables](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/process/variables?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml%2Cbatch)

  * [variable group](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/library/variable-groups?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml)

    available across multiple pipelines

* [Integrate with service hooks](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/service-hooks/overview?view=azure-devops)

---
## Implement code flow

### implement pull request strategies

* [Learn about pull request](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/repos/git/pull-requests-overview?view=azure-devops)

### implement branch and fork strategies

* [Learn about fork](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/repos/git/forks-overview?view=azure-devops)

### configure branch policies

* [Learn about branch policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/repos/git/branch-policies-overview?view=azure-devops)

* [Improve code quality with branch policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/repos/git/branch-policies?view=azure-devops)

---
## Implement a mobile DevOps strategy
[Azure App Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/appcenter/)  

[[MS Learn] Introduction to App Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/intro-to-app-center/)

### manage mobile target device sets and distribution groups

* [Manage App Center Distribution Groups](https://docs.microsoft.com/appcenter/distribution/groups)

  > As part of automating the workflow, you must provide the user name and password for your Apple ID and your production certificate in a .p12 format.

### manage target UI test device sets
### provision tester devices for deployment
### create public and private distribution groups

* [Manage App Center Distribution Groups](https://docs.microsoft.com/appcenter/distribution/groups)

  * Private Distribution Groups

  * Public Distribution Groups

  * Shared Distribution Groups

    > organization level

## Managing application configuration and secrets

### implement a secure and compliant development process

* [Learn how to add continuous security validation to your CI/CD pipeline](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/migrate/security-validation-cicd-pipeline?view=azure-devops)

* [Pipeline permissions and security roles](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/policies/permissions?view=azure-devops)

### implement general (non-secret) configuration data
### manage secrets, tokens, and certificates

* [Secure files](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/library/secure-files?view=azure-devops)

* [Set secret variables](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/process/variables?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml%2Cbatch#secret-variables)

* [Azure Key Vault Task](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/deploy/azure-key-vault?view=azure-devops)

  * Azure Key Vault Task need ```secretsFilter``` parameter, use ```secretsFilter: '*'``` to download all.

### implement applications configurations (e.g. Web App, Azure Kubernetes Service, containers)

* helm

  1. helm repo add

  1. helm install

* [Tutorial: Scale applications in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/aks/tutorial-kubernetes-scale)

* [Deploying Windows Containers with Azure Container Instances (ACI) Connector for Kubernetes](https://anthonychu.ca/post/windows-containers-aci-connector-kubernetes/)

  * Create service principal

    **contributor role** in the resource group

  * ```aci-connector.yaml```

  * ```kubectl```

### implement secrets management (e.g. Web App, Azure Kubernetes Service, containers, Azure Key Vault)
### implement tools for managing security and compliance in the pipeline

* [branch security](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/repos/git/branch-permissions?view=azure-devops)

* [About security roles](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/organizations/security/about-security-roles?view=azure-devops)

* [Security (service connection)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/library/service-endpoints?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml#secure-a-service-connection)

  * User permissions (**have project/organization scope**)

    |Role|Purpose|
    |-|-|
    |Reader|view service connection|
    |User|use service connection when authoring [build, release] pipeline or authorize yaml|
    |Creator|create service connection in the project </br> Contributors are added as members by default|
    |Administrator|manage membership </br> Project administrators added as members by  default|

  * Pipeline permissions

    * control which YAML pipelines are authorized to use this service connection
    
  * Project permissions

    * control which projects can use this service connection
