# Implement continuous integration (10-15%)
## Manage code quality and security policies

* [[MS Learn] Run functional tests in Azure Pipelines](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/run-functional-tests-azure-pipelines/index)  

* [[MS Learn] Run nonfunctional tests in Azure Pipelines](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/run-non-functional-tests-azure-pipelines/index)  

* [[MS Learn] Run quality tests in your build pipeline by using Azure Pipelines](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/run-quality-tests-build-pipeline/index)  

### monitor code quality
### configure build to report on code coverage

* [Publish Code Coverage Results task](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/test/publish-code-coverage-results?view=azure-devops)

* code coverage  

  compute the percentage of code that's covered by unit tests.  
include conditional branches in code to ensure that a function is completely covered.

* [[MS Learn] (ch 6) Run quality tests in your build pipeline by using Azure Pipelines](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/run-quality-tests-build-pipeline/6-perform-code-coverage)

    1. Install code coverage tool by NuGet package, and run locally

    1. modify pipeline yaml

* [(.NET Core) Collect code coverage](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/ecosystems/dotnet-core?view=azure-devops#collect-code-coverage)

### manage automated test quality

* test pyramid  

  if lower-level component works as expected in isolation,  
tests at higner levels need only verify that multiple components work together to get the expected result.

* Continuous testing  

    1. tests are run early in the development process

    1. as every moves through the pipeline.

* Shifting left  

    1. considering software quality

    1. testing earlier in the development process.

### manage test suites and categories
### monitor quality of tests
### integrate security analysis tools (e.g. SonarQube, WhiteSource Bolt, Open Web Application Security Project)

* WhiteSource Bolt

  finding and fixing open source vulnerabilities

* [SonarQube](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SonarSource.sonarqube)

  Code Quality and Security

  * [for azure devops](https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/analysis/scan/sonarscanner-for-azure-devops/)

    create service connection

---
## Implement a container build strategy

### create deployable images (e.g. Docker, Azure Container Registry)

* [optimize windows dockerfile](https://docs.microsoft.com/virtualization/windowscontainers/manage-docker/optimize-windows-dockerfile)

* Service containers must define a ```CMD``` or ```ENTRYPOINT```.  
The pipeline will ```docker run``` the provided container without additional arguments

* [[MS Learn]Azure Container Registry](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/build-and-store-container-images/)

* [(Azure Pipelines) Deploy apps using containers](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/ecosystems/containers/build-image?view=azure-devops)

* [(Azure Pipelines) Define container jobs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/process/container-phases?view=azure-devops)

### analyze and integrate Docker multi-stage builds

* [docker multi-stage](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/)

  * Each ```FROM``` instruction starts a new stage

```Dockerfile
# name stage or refer by their integer number(start with 0)
FROM golang:1.7.3 AS builder 
WORKDIR /go/src/github.com/alexellis/href-counter/
RUN go get -d -v golang.org/x/net/html  
COPY app.go    .
RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux go build -a -installsuffix cgo -o app .

FROM alpine:latest  
RUN apk --no-cache add ca-certificates
WORKDIR /root/
# the COPY doesnâ€™t break, --from=0 if not named
COPY --from=builder /go/src/github.com/alexellis/href-counter/app . 
CMD ["./app"]  
```

## Implement a build strategy

### design build triggers, tools, integrations, and workflow

* [[MS Learn] Implement a code workflow in your build pipeline by using Git and GitHub](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/implement-code-workflow/?view=azure-devops)

* [CI trigger](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/repos/github?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml#trigger-a-pipeline)

### implement a hybrid build process
### implement multi-agent builds
### recommend build tools and configuration (e.g. Azure Pipelines, Jenkins)

### set up an automated build workflow

* [Build and Deployment Automation Case Study for World Wide Time Keeping: Higher Quality and Faster Delivery in an Increasingly Agile World](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/migrate/build-deployment-best-practices?toc=%2Fazure%2Fdevops%2Fpipelines%2Ftoc.json&bc=%2Fazure%2Fdevops%2Fpipelines%2Fbreadcrumb%2Ftoc.json&view=azure-devops)
