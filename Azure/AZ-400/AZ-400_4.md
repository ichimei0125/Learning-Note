# Implement continuous delivery (10-15%)
## Design a release strategy

### recommend release tools
### identify and recommend release approvals and gates

* [Release deployment control using approvals](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/release/approvals/approvals?view=azure-devops)

  * If no approval is granted within the **Timeout** specified for the approval, the deployment is rejected.

* [Release approvals and gates overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/release/approvals/?view=azure-devops)

  * **Gates**  

    Gates allow automatic collection of health signals from external services, and then promote the release when all the signals are successful at the same time or stop the deployment on timeout.  
    Typically, gates are used in connection with incident management, problem management, change management, monitoring, and external approval systems.

### recommend strategy for measuring quality of release and release process
### recommend strategy for release notes and documentation

### select appropriate deployment pattern

---
## Set up a release management workflow

### automate inspection of health signals for release approvals by using release gates

* [Define a gate](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/release/approvals/gates?view=azure-devops)

### configure automated integration and functional test execution
### create a release pipeline (e.g. Azure Kubernetes Service, Service Fabric, WebApp)

* [[MS Learn] Create a release pipeline in Azure Pipelines](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/create-release-pipeline/)

* [Tutorial: Deploy an application with CI/CD to a Service Fabric cluster](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-tutorial-deploy-app-with-cicd-vsts)

  * add enviroment

    * endpoint

    * Server certificate thumbprint

* [Tutorial: Deploy ASP.NET Core apps to Azure Kubernetes Service with Azure DevOps Projects](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops-project/azure-devops-project-aks)

### create multi-phase release pipelines
### integrate secrets with release pipeline
### provision and configure environments

* [Create and target an environment
](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/process/environments)

### manage and modularize tasks and templates (e.g. task and variable groups)

* [Tasks & templates](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/process/tasks?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml)

---
## Implement an appropriate deployment pattern
* [[MS Learn] Manage release cadence in Azure Pipelines with deployment patterns](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/manage-release-cadence/index)

### implement blue-green deployments

* [Azure Traffic Manager](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/blue-green-deployments-using-azure-traffic-manager/)

  * [Weighted traffic-routing method](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/traffic-manager/traffic-manager-routing-methods#weighted-traffic-routing-method)

### implement canary deployments
### implement progressive exposure deployments
### scale a release pipeline to deploy to multiple endpoints (e.g. deployment groups, Azure Kubernetes Service, Service Fabric)

* [Provision deployment group](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/release/deployment-groups/?view=azure-devops)

  * A **deployment group** is a logical set of deployment target machines that have agents installed on each one. 

    another grouping of angents, like agent pool
