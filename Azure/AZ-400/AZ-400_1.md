# Design a DevOps strategy (20-25%)

## Recommend a migration and consolidation strategy for DevOps tools

### analyze existing artifact (e.g. deployment packages, NuGet, Maven, npm) and container repositories

### analyze existing test management tools

### analyze existing work management tools

### recommend migration and integration strategies for artifact repositories, source control, test management, and work management

* [Squash merge pull requests](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/repos/git/merging-with-squash?view=azure-devops)

* Azure DevOps Server move to Azure DevOps Services [migration options](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/migrate/migrate-from-tfs?view=azure-devops)

  tools > public API > manually

* [Source control integration in Azure Automation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/source-control-integration)

  * need Module ```AzureRM.Profile```

  * Automation Account -> Source Control -> Add

  * support

    1. GitHub

    1. Azure Repos(Git/TFVC)

## Design and implement an Agile work management approach

* Agile

  a **term** that's used to describe approaches to software development, emphasizing incremental delivery, team collaboration, continual planning, and continual learning.

### identify and recommend project metrics, KPIs, and DevOps measurements (e.g. cycle time, lead time, Azure Kubernetes Service, WIP limit)

* [Monitor your Kubernetes cluster performance with Azure Monitor for containers](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/insights/container-insights-analyze)

* [Widgets based on Analytics](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/report/dashboards/analytics-widgets?view=azure-devops)

* [Perspectives & Measure groups](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/report/sql-reports/perspective-measure-groups-cube?view=azure-devops-2019)

* Total lead time  
the time it takes for a feature to make it to the customer.

* Process time  
the time spent on a feature that has value to the customer.

* Activity radio  
process time / total lead time

* [Lead time and cycle time widgets](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/report/dashboards/cycle-time-and-lead-time?view=azure-devops)

  * cycle time widgets

    analyze the time it takes for your team to complete work items once they begin actively working on them

![cycle time & lead time](https://docs.microsoft.com/ja-jp/azure/devops/report/dashboards/media/cycle-lead-time-concept-intro.png?view=azure-devops)

* [WIP(Work in Progress) Limit](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/boards/boards/wip-limits?view=azure-devops)  

  * the amount of work your team undertakes at each work stage  

  * Cumulative Flow Diagram (CFD)

    count of work items over time for each column of a Kanban board


### implement tools and processes to support Agile work management
* [Agile Process](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/boards/work-items/guidance/agile-process?view=azure-devops)

### mentor team members on Agile techniques and practices

* [Agile culture](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/boards/plans/agile-culture?view=azure-devops)

* [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/)

    * Individuals and interactions over processes and tools

    * Working software over comprehensive documentation

    * Customer collaboration over contract negotiation

    * Responding to change over following a plan

### recommend an organization structure that supports scaling Agile practices

* [Scaling Agile - Practices that scale](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/boards/plans/practices-that-scale?view=azure-devops)

* [team structure](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/boards/plans/agile-culture?view=azure-devops#feature-teams)

### recommend in-team and cross-team collaboration mechanisms

* [visibility across teams](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/boards/plans/visibility-across-teams?view=azure-devops)

    * delivery plan

        * **Creator** of the plan can edit the permissions.

    * portfolio backlogs

        * management teams - Epics

        * feature teams - Features & Stories

## Design a quality strategy

* [[MS Learn] Run quality tests in your build pipeline by using Azure Pipelines](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/run-quality-tests-build-pipeline/index)

### analyze existing quality environment

### identify and recommend quality metrics

### recommend a strategy for feature flag lifecycle

* feature flag

  to enable (expose) and disable (hide) features in a solution, even before they are complete and ready for release

### recommend a strategy for measuring and managing technical debt

* **Technical debt** is the set of problems in a development effort that make forward progress on customer value inefficient.

* SonarQube

  * [Technical Debt Management: Announcing SonarQube integration with MSBuild and Team Build](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/technical-debt-management-announcing-sonarqube-integration-with-msbuild-and-team-build/)

### recommend changes to team structure to optimize quality

### recommend performance testing strategy

---

## Design a secure development process

### inspect and validate code base for compliance

### inspect and validate infrastructure for compliance

### recommend a secure development strategy

### recommend tools and practices to integrate code security validation (e.g. static code analysis)

  * [Java](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/java/standalone-tools?view=azure-devops) 

    Maven/Gradle: PMD, CheckStyle, FindBugs

### recommend tools and practices to integrate infrastructure security validation

---
## Design a tool integration strategy

### design a license management strategy (e.g. VSTS users, concurrent pipelines, test environments, open source software licensing, DevOps tools and services, package management licensing)
### design a strategy for end-to-end traceability from work items to working software
### design a strategy for integrating monitoring and feedback to development teams
### design an authentication and access strategy

* [Choosing the right authentication mechanism](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/integrate/get-started/authentication/authentication-guidance?view=azure-devops)

* [Authenticate access with personal access tokens](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate?view=azure-devops&tabs=preview-page)

* [Use Git Credential Managers to authenticate to Azure Repos](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/repos/git/set-up-credential-managers?view=azure-devops)

### design a strategy for integrating on-premises and cloud resources
