# Implement continuous feedback (10-15%)
## Recommend and design system feedback mechanisms
* [[MS Learn] Recommend and design system feedback mechanisms](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/recommend-system-feedback-mechanisms/)

### design practices to measure end-user satisfaction (e.g. Send a Smile, app analytics)
### design processes to capture and analyze user feedback from external sources (e.g. Twitter, Reddit, Help Desk)

* [Exploratory testing with the Test & Feedback extension in Connected mode](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/test/connected-mode-exploratory-testing?view=azure-devops)

  * Stakeholder

    respond to feedback requests or to provide feedback voluntarily(自発的に)

### design routing for client application crash report data
### recommend monitoring tools and technologies

* [about notification](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/notifications/about-notifications?view=azure-devops)

* Synthetic monitoring

  Synthetic monitoring uses a set of transactions to assess performance and availability. Synthetic transactions are predictable tests that have the advantage of allowing comparison from release to release in a highly predictable manner.

  Developers, testers, and operations staff all need to ensure that their internet and intranet mobile applications and web applications are tested and operate successfully from different points of presence around the world.

* Alert management

  Developers, testers, and operations teams all need the ability to send notifications through email, voice mail, text, mobile push notifications and instant messages when specific situations or events occur in development, testing, or production environments. This gets the right people's attention at the right times.

* Deployment automation

  Developers, testers, and operations staff use different tools to schedule and deploy complex applications and configure them in development, testing, and production environments.

* Analytics

  Developers need to be able to look for patterns in log messages to identify if there is a problem in the code. Operators need to perform root cause analysis across multiple log files to identify the source of the problem in complex applications and systems.

### recommend system and feature usage tracking tools

* [telemetry](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/recommend-system-feedback-mechanisms/6-automate-application-analytics#recommend-system-and-feature-usage-tracking-tools)

## Implement process for routing system feedback to development teams

* [[MS Learn] Route system feedback to development teams](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/route-system-feedback/1-introduction)

### configure crash report integration for client applications
### develop monitoring and status dashboards
### implement routing for client application crash report data
### implement tools to track system usage, feature usage, and flow
### integrate and configure ticketing systems with development team's work management system (e.g. IT Service Management connector, ServiceNow Cloud Management, App Insights work items)

---
## Optimize feedback mechanisms

* [[MS Learn] Manage site reliability](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/manage-site-reliability/5-analyze-alerts-baseline#analyze-alerts-to-establish-a-baseline)

### [analyze alerts to establish a baseline](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/manage-site-reliability/5-analyze-alerts-baseline)

  |State|Description|
  |-|-|
  |New|	The issue has been detected and has not yet been reviewed.|
  |Acknowledged|An administrator has reviewed the alert and started working on it.|
  |Closed|The issue has been resolved. After an alert has been closed, you can reopen it by changing it to another state.|

### [analyze telemetry to establish a baseline](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/manage-site-reliability/3-analyze-telemetry-baseline)

### perform live site reviews and capture feedback for system outages

### [perform ongoing tuning to reduce meaningless or non-actionable alerts](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/manage-site-reliability/4-perform-ongoing-tuning)
