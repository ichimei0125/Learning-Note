# Implement dependency management (5-10%)
## Design a dependency management strategy
[[MS Learn] Manage build dependencies with Azure Artifacts](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/manage-build-dependencies/)

### recommend artifact management tools and practices (Azure Artifacts, npm, Maven, Nuget)

* [Azure Artifacts](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/artifacts/?view=azure-devops)  

  container -> feed

### abstract common packages to enable sharing and reuse

### inspect codebase to identify code dependencies that can be converted to packages

* One tradeoff is that with a package, you have **another codebase** to test and maintain.  
You must also be careful when adding features. 

* When multiple applications can benefit from the same code, the advantages far outweigh the disadvantages.  
You have just one codebase, just one set of tests, and just one build process to manage.

### identify and recommend standardized package types and versions across the solution

* [key concepts](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/artifacts/artifacts-key-concepts?view=azure-devops)

    1. immutability

       version

    1. recycle bin  

       recover the package which be deleted

### refactor existing build pipelines to implement version strategy that publishes packages

---
## Manage security and compliance

### inspect open source software packages for security and license compliance to align with corporate standards (e.g. GPLv3)

### configure build pipeline to access package security and license rating (e.g. Black Duck, White Source)

* [Black Duck](https://www.synopsys.com/software-integrity/security-testing/software-composition-analysis.html)

  helps organizations identify and manage open source security, license compliance and operational risks across applications and containers

* WhiteSource Bolt

  a tool for scanning open-source dependencies for vulnerabilities and licensing

* [[MS Learn] Scan open source components for vulnerabilities and license ratings in Azure Pipelines](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/scan-open-source/index)  

* [[MS Learn] Scan code for vulnerabilities in Azure Pipelines](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/scan-for-vulnerabilities/index)

### configure secure access to package feeds

* [Set Azure Artifacts Permission](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/artifacts/feeds/feed-permissions?view=azure-devops)
